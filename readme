Test documentation : 

 I have written the following  automation test in java/reassured :

 - Create a post
 - Update a post
 - Find a inexistent post


The test: 

- I have  implemented the build pattern  in order to demonstrate how a  rest-assured automation for rest-api can be automated.


Constrains :

 * Given that the post are not created in the database, I have created the resource (e.g a post ) and have asserted that  it was returned  via the API.  I did not perform checks to see if the resource  have been saved .


Requirement to run the test: 

This is a maven project created in Java using the rest assured library.  Java and maven are necessary in order to perform the test
The tests can be run via the comment line
 mvn -Dtest=PostTest test
I have added the maven-surefire-report-plugin in order to create a report of the run.

It is expected that searchForAnInexistentPost fails and the other test passes.
